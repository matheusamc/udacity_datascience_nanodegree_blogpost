<h2>Cidade Maravilhosa: Where to stay and how much to pay?</h2>

* Numpy
* matplotlib
  
### Files

## Project Description
This project is part of the requirements of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In this project we want to explorer the avaible data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/rio-de-janeiro/">Inside Airbnb</a> for the listings in Rio de Janeiro for the year of 2022. Taking a closer look at this data we expect to answer the following questions:

* <i>What neighbourhoods have the most listing oportunities?</i>
* <i>What price is expected to pay in these places during the main events in the city?</i>
* <i>What time of the year to come paying better prices?</i>
* <i>What places to stay paying better prices?</i>

We will make use of some Python libraries in a Jupyter notebook and the knowledge achieved in the course to answer these questions.
