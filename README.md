<h2>Cidade Maravilhosa: Where to stay and how much to pay?</h2>
<p>A data based approach using Airbnb's data from 2022 to find best prices and areas to stay in the city of Rio de Janeiro. This project is part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree.</p>

<h2>Project Intro</h2>

<p>The purpose of this project is to find some information about prices and places to stay in Rio de Janeiro and serve as a simple but useful guide for travelers. This project was developed in Python using Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
  <p>This project is part of the requirements of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. In this project we want to explorer the avaible data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/rio-de-janeiro/">Inside Airbnb</a> for the listings in Rio de Janeiro for the year of 2022. Taking a closer look at this data we expect to answer the following questions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>In what neighbourhood to stay in Rio?</i></li>
    <li><i>What price weexpected to pay in these places during the main events in the city?</i></li>
    <li><i>What time of the year to come paying better prices?</i></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will make use of some Python libraries in a Jupyter notebook and the knowledge achieved in the course to answer these questions.</p>

<h2>Summary of Results</h2>
  <p>After analisyng the avaiable data we answered the three questions above:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The locations with most listing in Airbnb which include Copacabana, Ipanema, Barra da Tijuca, Leblon, Botafogo, Santa Teresa, Centro, Flamengo, Leme and Laranjeiras.</li>
    <li>During New Years' Eve and Carnival, someone would expect to pay from US$90/day to US$350/day.</li>
    <li>The period from the end of July to the beggining of November is the one with best prices.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The results are detailed presented in <a href="https://medium.com/@matheusamc/cidade-maravilhosa-when-to-visit-1a35d1ba7e1f">this post</a>.</p>
